## Project Management

Tickets for Project Tanager will be listed in [Ed-Fi
Tracker](https://tracker.ed-fi.org) under projects [Data Management
Service](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DMS%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Epic%20ORDER%20BY%20fixVersion)
and [Configuration
Service](https://tracker.ed-fi.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20cs%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Epic%20ORDER%20BY%20fixVersion).
These links will take you to open epics; from there you can dig into epics of
interest to find tickets. In general, when looking for ticket to work on, we
recommend looking for the  `up-for-grabs` label or looking for tickets in the
_next_ planned release. Please coordinate directly with the Ed-Fi Alliance tech
team if you are interested in contributing to a feature or fix in the _current_
release, to ensure that we do not accidentally duplicate effort.

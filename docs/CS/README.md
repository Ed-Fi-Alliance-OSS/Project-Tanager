# Ed-Fi Configuration Service Features and Design

> [!NOTE]
> Rough notes:
>
> * Supports Admin API specification (version 2.2) (MOSTLY)
> * Consider expansion to handle tenant registration and/or creation (replace
>   Sandbox Admin?). New API specification.
> * Consider cache management. Should an API go here or in the Data Management
>   Service? Maybe DMS via a webhook?
>   * On claimset definition change, need to propagate update to DMS cache. POST a
>     command to the DMS with a simple webhook, it then initiates retrieval of
>     full claimset information.
>   * Is that sufficiently secure?
> * Need sys admin authorization.
> * Must support key rotation procedure

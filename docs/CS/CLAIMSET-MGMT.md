# Claimset Management

Ed-Fi API security relies on the concept of a claimset, which groups together
the operations allowed by an API client in the following dimensions:

* Authorization Strategy (namespace, ownership, various relationships, or no
  restriction).
* Resource - all of the entities in both the Resource API and the Descriptors
  API
  * There is also a hierarchy: for example, grouping some Descriptors together
    as "system descriptors" or "managed descriptors", or grouping together all
    education organizations.
* Actions (create, read, update, delete, and read changes (change queries)).

## Legacy Approach

### Database Model

In the ODS/API and the Admin API applications, the security metadata is stored in the `EdFi_Security` database modeled relationally using the following 4 core entities:

* **ResourceClaims** - Represent nodes in a hierarchy with 3 types of claims represented: resources (representing data management API endpoints), domains (for organizing related resource claims into logical groups) and services (functional areas of the API, such as identity).

* **Actions** - Represents different actions that can be performed on resources such as Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD), but is also extensible for other use cases (such as ReadChanges for clients performing change processing or the ReadHistory offered by the Nebraska DOE Longitudinal API).

* **AuthorizationStrategies** - Represents different approaches that can be used for performing authorization beyond the basic actions such as associating an API caller with students through school responsibilities rather than enrollment).

* **ClaimSets** - Represents a pre-defined set of specific resource permissions and strategies that can be assigned to API clients, also sometimes called a “role”.

The remaining tables capture metadata related to the association of these entities.

  Action ||--o{ ClaimSetResourceClaimActions : has
  AuthorizationStrategies ||--o{ ResourceClaimActionAuthorizationStrategies : has
  AuthorizationStrategies ||--o{ClaimSetResourceClaimActionAuthorizationStrategyOverrides : has
  ClaimSetResourceClaimActions ||--o{ ClaimSetResourceClaimActionAuthorizationStrategyOverrides : has
  ClaimSets ||--o{ ClaimSetResourceClaimActions : has
  ResourceClaimActions ||--o{ ResourceClaimActionAuthorizationStrategies : has
  ResourceClaims ||--o{ ClaimSetResourceClaimActions : has
  ResourceClaims ||--o{ ResourceClaims : has
  ResourceClaims ||--o{ ResourceClaimActions : has
```

### Admin API REST Interface

The Admin API interface supports the following operations related to these tables:

* /action
  * GET all
* /authorizationStrategies
  * GET all
* /claimsets
  * Regular CRUD operations:
    * GET all
    * GET by id
    * POST
    * PUT
    * DELETE
  * CLOB ("Character Large OBject") operations, which unifies all of the dimensions of a Claimset into one payload:
    * GET /export
    * POST /copy
    * POST /import
  * /claimsets/{id}/resourceClaimActions
    * POST
    * PUT
    * DELETE
    * /claimsets/{id}/resourceClaimActions/{id}
      * POST overrideAuthorizationStrategy
      * POST resetAuthorizationStrategies
* /resourceClaims
  * GET all
  * GET by id

The read-only endpoint return essentially hard-coded lists, so that a user will
know what ID values to use in constructing the payload for the CLOB operations
or resourceClaimActions operations.

## Proposed Approach

### Data Model

The DMS Configuration Service needs to support client tools built to interact
with Admin API 2. One of the challenges of moving to a full-JSON-based resource claim hierarchy is the management of the identities of the _entities_ of the existing security metadata model described earlier.

Thus, DMS will use a hybrid model that retains those entity tables exactly as they currently appear in the `EdFi_Security` database with the following exceptions:

* The self-recursive `ParentResourceClaimId` column of the `ResourceClaims` table will be removed in favor of managing the hierarchy in JSON.

* The `ActionUri` in the `Actions` table has not shown to provide any particular value above the more succinct `ActionName` and will be dropped from the model.

The security metadata stored in the join tables of the EdFi_Security database will be managed using JSON in a new table named "ClaimsHierarchy".

The DMS Configuration Service data model for managing security metadata will be as follows:

```mermaid
erDiagram
  ResourceClaim {
    ResourceClaimId int
    ResourceName varchar(255)
    ClaimName varchar(850)
  }
  Action {
    ActionId int
    ActionName varchar(255)
  }
  AuthorizationStrategy {
    AuthorizationStrategyId int
    AuthorizationStrategyName varchar(255)
    DisplayName varchar(255)
  }
  ClaimSet {
    ClaimSetId int
    ClaimSetName varchar(255)
    IsEdFiPreset bit
    ForApplicationUseOnly bit
  }
  ClaimsHierarchy {
    ClaimsHierarchyId int
    ProjectName varchar(20)
    Version varchar(10)
    Hierarchy jsonb
  }
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Admin API specification already describes the identifiers as integers. We
> will stick with that convention, rather than trying to switch to a UUID.

## REST API Implications

The DMS Configuration Service will not, initially, support all of the Admin API
endpoints. Further discussion with the affected community members is needed to
determine if this is a viable long-term direction.

Initially, the key goal is to enable the DMS to retrieve claim set information
from the Configuration Service. However, the DMS represents a
different type of consumer -- one that is consuming the security metadata for the
purpose of making authorization decisions. The Admin API has been designed for
consumers performing security metadata management. For this reason, the DMS Configuration Service will implement a new endpoint that supports this use case:

* `GET /v2/authorizations?claimSetName=SIS%20Vendor`
  * Returns a JSON response containing all the resources accessible to API clients assigned to the specified claim set, along with the authorization metadata for making authorization decisions and applying necessary authorization-based data filtering.

  The structure of the response body will be as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "resources": [ ],
    "authorizations": [ ]
  }
  ```

  The objects in the `resources` array will be structured as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "http://ed-fi.org/ods/identity/claims/ed-fi/academicSubjectDescriptor",
    "authorization": 1
  }
  ```

  The objects in `authorizations` array will be structured as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "actions": [
      "name": "Create",
      "authorizationStrategies": [
        {
          "name": "NamespaceBased"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Read",
      "authorizationStrategies": [
        {
          "name": "NoFurtherAuthorizationRequired"
        }
      ],
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

  An observant reader will notice that this response does not include a
  hierarchy. The resource claim hierarchy, along with defaults and overrides at
  different levels, pertains to security metadata management but is not required
  for authorization _decisions_. While the API response accounts for these
  concepts, consumers will only receive the information necessary for making
  authorization decisions.

### Supported Endpoints

#### ClaimSets

In the claimset GET requests, the readonly `_applications` array implies that
the query needs to join to the `Application` table. Thus the `Application` table
needs an index on `ClaimSetName`.

* `GET /v2/claimSets/{id}/export`
* `GET /v2/claimSets`
  * Return the simple response body defined in the Admin API specification.
  * Includes paging operations.
* `GET /v2/claimSets?verbose=true`
  * Returns the entire CLOB, with the same response as the `/export` endpoint.
  * Needs to support the normal paging operations, though `offset` and `limit`
    should _not_ be required fields.
* `GET /v2/claimSets/{id}`
  * Return the simple response body defined in the Admin API specification.
* `GET /v2/claimSets/{id}?verbose=true`
  * Returns the entire CLOB, with the same response as the `/export` endpoint.
* `POST /v2/claimSets`
  * In the Admin API interface, only the `name` is used. Continue supporting
    that. Basically, this is creating a placeholder with no useful information.
  * Also support accepting the entire `resourceClaims` CLOB payload, just like
    the `/import` endpoint.
  * If the `name` already exists, perform an `UPDATE` instead of re-inserting.

  > [!NOTE]
  > ClaimSet `name` must be unique.

* `PUT /v2/claimSets/{id}`
  * There is a small mistake in the Admin API specification, and we should fix
    that right now. Thus we have a breaking change compared to the Admin API 2.2
    specification. A `PUT` request _by definition_ must include the entire
    resource. In the DMS, we have interpreted that to mean that the `id` value
    is required in the payload. It also means that a request with only `{ "id":
    1, "name": "claimset name" }` would completely remove the `resourceClaims`
    node. Except for any metadata, we store _exactly_ what was received in the
    `PUT` request.
* `DELETE /v2/claimSets/{id}`
* `POST /v2/claimSets/copy`
* `POST /v2/claimSets/import`
  * Becomes a synonym to `/v2/claimSets`, except that now the `resourceClaims`
    array will be a required attribute.

#### AuthorizationStrategies

Support full CRUD operations on `/v2/authorizationStrategies`, even though the Admin API
specification only includes the read operations.

#### Actions

Continue supporting the read-only hard-coded list for `/v2/actions`.

### Unsupported Endpoints

At this time, the following endpoints will not be supported in the Configuration
Service, because the `/v2/claimSets` will provide the same support. This is
subject to change based on community feedback.

* `/v2/resourceClaims`
* `/v2/resourceClaims/{id}`
* `/v2/claimSets/{claimSetId}/resourceClaimActions/{resourceClaimId}/overrideAuthorizationStrategy`
* `/v2/claimSets/{claimSetId}/resourceClaimActions/{resourceClaimId}/resetAuthorizationStrategies`
* `/v2/claimSets/{claimSetId}/resourceClaimActions`
* `/v2/claimSets/{claimSetId}/resourceClaimActions/{resourceClaimId}`
* `/v2/claimSets/{claimSetId}/resourceClaimActions/{resourceClaimId}`

## Summary of Changes Compared to Admin API 2.2 Specification

* `offset` and `limit` should not be required parameters
* `PUT` requests will require the presence of the matching `id` attribute in the
  request body.
* Both `POST` and `PUT` on `/v2/claimSets` will support use of the
  `resourceClaims` attribute.
* A `GET` request to `/v2/claimSets` or `/v2/claimSets/{id}` will return the
  `resourceClaims` array _if_ query string parameter `verbose` is received with
  value `true`.

Thus, we have begun defining elements of an Admin API **3.0** specification.

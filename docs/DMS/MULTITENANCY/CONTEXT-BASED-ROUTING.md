# Context-Based Routing for Multi-Instance DMS

## Overview

The Ed-Fi Data Management Service (DMS) supports explicit data segmentation through context-based routing using **route qualifiers**. This approach allows API requests to include contextual values (such as school year, district ID, or other identifiers) in the URL path, enabling the same API clients to access multiple DMS instances with a single set of credentials.

## Key Concept

Context-based routing enables a single DMS deployment to serve multiple isolated data instances, each identified by one or more route qualifiers. For example:

- `/255901/2024/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to District 255901's 2024 school year database
- `/255901/2025/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to District 255901's 2025 school year database
- `/255902/2024/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to District 255902's 2024 school year database

The primary benefit is allowing the same API client credentials to access multiple segregated databases based on URL context, without requiring separate authentication for each instance.

## Configuration Overview

To enable context-based routing, administrators use the **DMS Configuration Service** to:

1. **Create DMS Database Instances** - Define separate database instances with connection strings
2. **Define Route Contexts** - Associate each instance with one or more context key-value pairs
3. **Configure Applications** - Grant applications access to multiple instances

## URL Pattern

When context-based routing is configured, API requests follow this pattern:

```
http://{host}:{port}/{qualifier1}/{qualifier2}/.../data/ed-fi/{resource}
```

**Examples:**

- `http://localhost:8080/255901/2024/data/ed-fi/students`
- `http://localhost:8080/255901/2025/data/ed-fi/schools`
- `http://localhost:8080/255902/2024/data/ed-fi/contentClassDescriptors`

The order and number of route qualifiers must match the context keys defined for your instances.

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Authenticate with Configuration Service

Obtain an access token from the DMS Configuration Service:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id={your_admin_client_id}
&client_secret={your_admin_secret}
&grant_type=client_credentials
&scope=edfi_admin_api/full_access
```

### Step 2: Create DMS Instances

Create a separate DMS instance for each database you want to route to:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/v2/dmsInstances
Authorization: bearer {config_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "instanceType": "District",
  "instanceName": "District 255901 - School Year 2024",
  "connectionString": "host=dms-postgresql;port=5432;username=postgres;password=yourpassword;database=edfi_datamanagementservice_d255901_sy2024;"
}
```

The response will include an `id` field that you'll use to associate route contexts.

### Step 3: Define Route Contexts

For each instance, create route context entries that define how URL segments map to that instance:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/v2/dmsInstanceRouteContexts
Authorization: bearer {config_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "instanceId": 1,
  "contextKey": "districtId",
  "contextValue": "255901"
}
```

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/v2/dmsInstanceRouteContexts
Authorization: bearer {config_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "instanceId": 1,
  "contextKey": "schoolYear",
  "contextValue": "2024"
}
```

**Important:** Each instance can have multiple route contexts. DMS requires **all** context keys to match for routing to succeed.

### Step 4: Create Vendor and Application

Create a vendor and application that has access to multiple instances:

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/v2/vendors
Authorization: bearer {config_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "company": "Your Organization",
  "contactName": "Admin Name",
  "contactEmailAddress": "admin@example.edu",
  "namespacePrefixes": "uri://ed-fi.org,uri://yourorg.edu"
}
```

```http
POST http://localhost:8081/v2/applications
Authorization: bearer {config_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "vendorId": 1,
  "applicationName": "Multi-Instance Application",
  "claimSetName": "SIS Vendor",
  "educationOrganizationIds": [255901, 255902],
  "dmsInstanceIds": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

The response will include `key` and `secret` fields for API authentication.

## Using Context-Based Routing

### Authentication

Authenticate with the DMS API using your application credentials:

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/connect/token
Authorization: basic {application_key}:{application_secret}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials
```

### Making Requests

Include the route qualifiers in the URL path before `/data/ed-fi/`:

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/255901/2024/data/ed-fi/students
Authorization: bearer {dms_token}
```

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/255901/2025/data/ed-fi/schools
Authorization: bearer {dms_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "schoolId": 123,
  "nameOfInstitution": "Example School",
  ...
}
```

### How Instance Resolution Works

When DMS receives a request:

1. **Extracts route qualifiers** from the URL path (e.g., `255901` and `2024`)
2. **Matches against route contexts** to find an instance where all context key-value pairs match
3. **Routes the request** to the matched instance's database
4. **Returns 404** if no instance matches the provided qualifiers

## Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Year-Specific Routing

Route requests to different databases based on school year:

**Instance Configuration:**

| Instance | Database | Context Key | Context Value |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | edfi_dms_2024 | schoolYear | 2024 |
| 2 | edfi_dms_2025 | schoolYear | 2025 |

**API Usage:**

- `GET /2024/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to `edfi_dms_2024`
- `GET /2025/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to `edfi_dms_2025`

### Example 2: District-Specific Routing

Route requests to different databases based on district:

**Instance Configuration:**

| Instance | Database | Context Key | Context Value |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | edfi_dms_district_255901 | districtId | 255901 |
| 2 | edfi_dms_district_255902 | districtId | 255902 |

**API Usage:**

- `GET /255901/data/ed-fi/schools` → Routes to `edfi_dms_district_255901`
- `GET /255902/data/ed-fi/schools` → Routes to `edfi_dms_district_255902`

### Example 3: Multi-Dimensional Routing

Route requests based on both district and school year:

**Instance Configuration:**

| Instance | Database | Context Keys | Context Values |
|----------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | edfi_dms_d255901_sy2024 | districtId, schoolYear | 255901, 2024 |
| 2 | edfi_dms_d255901_sy2025 | districtId, schoolYear | 255901, 2025 |
| 3 | edfi_dms_d255902_sy2024 | districtId, schoolYear | 255902, 2024 |

**API Usage:**

- `GET /255901/2024/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to `edfi_dms_d255901_sy2024`
- `GET /255901/2025/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to `edfi_dms_d255901_sy2025`
- `GET /255902/2024/data/ed-fi/students` → Routes to `edfi_dms_d255902_sy2024`

## Error Handling

### No Instance Found (404)

If no instance matches the provided route qualifiers, DMS returns a 404 response:

```http
GET /999999/2024/data/ed-fi/students
Authorization: bearer {token}

Response: 404 Not Found
```

This can occur when:

- An invalid district ID or school year is provided
- The application doesn't have access to the requested instance
- No route contexts match the qualifier combination

### Missing Route Qualifiers

If route qualifiers are required but not provided in the URL, the request may fail:

```http
GET /data/ed-fi/students
Authorization: bearer {token}

Response: 404 Not Found or 400 Bad Request
```

## Important Notes

- **All context keys must match**: If an instance has multiple route contexts (e.g., districtId and schoolYear), the request URL must provide values for all of them in the correct order.
- **Application access control**: Applications must be explicitly granted access to instances via the `dmsInstanceIds` field when creating the application.
- **Route qualifier order**: The order of route qualifiers in the URL should be consistent across your API implementation.
- **Discovery API**: Route qualifiers are included in Location headers and should be used consistently across all operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **No default instance**: Unlike single-instance deployments, there is no default database when using context-based routing. Route qualifiers are always required.

## Migration from ODS/API

If you're migrating from the Ed-Fi ODS/API platform that used `OdsContextRouteTemplate`:

| ODS/API Feature | DMS Equivalent |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `OdsContextRouteTemplate` in ApiSettings | Route contexts defined via Configuration Service API |
| `dbo.OdsInstances` table | `POST /v2/dmsInstances` endpoint |
| `dbo.OdsInstanceContext` table | `POST /v2/dmsInstanceRouteContexts` endpoint |
| ASP.NET route template syntax | Standard URL path segments |

## Summary

Context-based routing in DMS provides a powerful way to segment data while maintaining a unified API surface. By configuring instances and route contexts through the Configuration Service, you can:

- Support multiple districts with a single API deployment
- Maintain year-over-year historical data in separate databases
- Use flexible multi-dimensional routing (district + year, or other combinations)
- Grant applications access to multiple instances with a single credential

This approach is ideal for multi-tenant scenarios, regional data centers, and organizations that need to maintain strict data segregation while providing a consistent API experience.

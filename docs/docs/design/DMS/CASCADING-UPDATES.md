# Cascading Updates

* See Meadowlark's [Design for Offline Cascading
  Updates](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/Meadowlark/blob/main/docs/design/offline-cascading-updates/README.md)
* But that might only apply if you are using a separate "read" database. If
  reading from the same database as writing to, then the cascading might be
  expected to occur immediately?
* Also need to think about a tangential issue with streaming, as mentioned in
  the Meadowlark docs: [Reference Validation
  Correctness](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/Meadowlark/blob/main/docs/design/reference-validation-correctness/README.md)

# Change Data Capture to Stream

:::note

Braindump:

* Related question in [Primary Data Storage](./DATA-STORAGE-SCHEMA-GEN.md): where
  to store JSON for streaming. One primary table or an outbox table?
* Debezium, Kafka, Kafka Connect.
* Simple demonstration of data lake style storage.
* Review at least one other streaming platform to see if it has any implications
  for application design.
* Review and document security considerations.
